# Webscrapper
Python webscrapper

This python webscrapper was an educational project in understanding how to gather data from the web and to assist in quickly
creating a small amount of dummy data to write to .csv files to be used in a group class project.

The script does not crawl the website but instead links must be read through a .txt file named 'websites.txt' and a random
pause between 10-15 seconds is deliberately initiated between each link read as to make sure the script is not being disruptive
in anyway.
